**Generate speech, sound effects, music and beyond.**

This repo currently support: 

- **Text-to-Audio Generation**: Generate audio given text input.
- **Audio-to-Audio Generation**: Given an audio, generate another audio that contain the same type of sound. 
- **Text-guided Audio-to-Audio Style Transfer**: Transfer the sound of an audio into another one using the text description.

<hr>

## Important tricks to make your generated audio sound better
1. Try to provide more hints to AudioLDM, such as using more adjectives to describe your sound (e.g., clearly, high quality) or make your target more specific (e.g., "water stream in a forest" instead of "stream"). This can make sure AudioLDM understand what you want. 
2. Try to use different random seeds, which can affect the generation quality significantly sometimes.
3. It's best to use general terms like 'man' or 'woman' instead of specific names for individuals or abstract objects that humans may not be familiar with.

# Change Log

**2023-04-10**: Try to finetune AudioLDM with MusicCaps and AudioCaps datasets. Add three more checkpoints, including audioldm-m-text-ft, audioldm-s-text-ft, and audioldm-m-full.

**2023-03-04**: Add two more checkpoints, one is small model with more training steps, another is a large model. Add model selection in the Gradio APP.

**2023-02-24**: Add audio-to-audio generation. Add test cases. Add a pipeline (python function) for audio super-resolution and inpainting.

**2023-02-15**: Add audio style transfer. Add more options on generation.

## Web APP

The web APP currently only support Text-to-Audio generation. For full functionality please refer to the [Commandline Usage](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM#commandline-usage).

1. Prepare running environment
```shell
conda create -n audioldm python=3.8; conda activate audioldm
pip3 install git+https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM.git
git clone https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM; cd AudioLDM
```
2. Start the web application (powered by Gradio)
```shell
python3 app.py
```
3. A link will be printed out. Click the link to open the browser and play.

## Commandline Usage
Prepare running environment
```shell
# Optional
conda create -n audioldm python=3.8; conda activate audioldm
# Install AudioLDM
pip3 install git+https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM.git
```

:star2: **Text-to-Audio Generation**: generate an audio guided by a text
```shell
# The default --mode is "generation"
audioldm -t "A hammer is hitting a wooden surface" 
# Result will be saved in "./output/generation"
```

:star2: **Audio-to-Audio Generation**: generate an audio guided by an audio (output will have similar audio events as the input audio file).
```shell
audioldm --file_path trumpet.wav
# Result will be saved in "./output/generation_audio_to_audio/trumpet"
```

:star2: **Text-guided Audio-to-Audio Style Transfer**
```shell
# Test run
# --file_path is the original audio file for transfer
# -t is the text AudioLDM uses for transfer. 
# Please make sure that --file_path exist
audioldm --mode "transfer" --file_path trumpet.wav -t "Children Singing" 
# Result will be saved in "./output/transfer/trumpet"

# Tune the value of --transfer_strength is important!
# --transfer_strength: A value between 0 and 1. 0 means original audio without transfer, 1 means completely transfer to the audio indicated by text
audioldm --mode "transfer" --file_path trumpet.wav -t "Children Singing" --transfer_strength 0.25
```

:gear: How to choose between different model checkpoints?
```
# Add the --model_name parameter, choice={audioldm-m-text-ft, audioldm-s-text-ft, audioldm-m-full, audioldm-s-full,audioldm-l-full,audioldm-s-full-v2}
audioldm --model_name audioldm-s-full
```

- :star: audioldm-m-full (default, **recommend**): the medium AudioLDM without finetuning and trained with audio embeddings as condition *(added 2023-04-10)*.
- :star: audioldm-s-full (**recommend**): the original open-sourced version *(added 2023-02-01)*.
- :star: audioldm-s-full-v2 (**recommend**): more training steps comparing with audioldm-s-full *(added 2023-03-04)*.
- audioldm-s-text-ft: the small AudioLDM finetuned with AudioCaps and MusicCaps audio-text pairs *(added 2023-04-10)*.
- audioldm-m-text-ft: the medium large AudioLDM finetuned with AudioCaps and MusicCaps audio-text pairs *(added 2023-04-10)*.
- audioldm-l-full: larger model comparing with audioldm-s-full *(added 2023-03-04)*.

> @haoheliu personally did a evaluation regarding the overall quality of the checkpoint, which gives audioldm-m-full (6.85/10), audioldm-s-full (6.62/10), audioldm-s-text-ft (6/10), audioldm-m-text-ft (5.46/10). These score are only for reference and may not reflect the true performance of the checkpoint. Checkpoint performance also varying with different text input as well.

:grey_question: For more options on guidance scale, batchsize, seed, ddim steps, etc., please run
```shell
audioldm -h
```
```console

# Hugging Face ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

AudioLDM is available in the Hugging Face [ðŸ§¨ Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library from v0.15.0 onwards. The official checkpoints can be found on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/cvssp), alongside [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/audioldm) and [examples scripts](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/audioldm).

To install Diffusers and Transformers, run:
```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers
```

You can then load pre-trained weights into the [AudioLDM pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/audioldm) and generate text-conditional audio outputs:
```python
from diffusers import AudioLDMPipeline
import torch

repo_id = "cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2"
pipe = AudioLDMPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Techno music with a strong, upbeat tempo and high melodic riffs"
audio = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=10, audio_length_in_s=5.0).audios[0]
```
